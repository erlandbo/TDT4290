## About

FDY-CRNN is currently a state of the art model (source: [paperswithcode](https://paperswithcode.com/task/sound-event-detection)) on sound event detection on the [DESED](https://github.com/turpaultn/DESED) dataset. 

The DESED dataset is a dataset of a lot of short audio clips and their corresponding metadata based on the type of dataset it is. The dataset contains a real dataset, a synthetic dataset, and a public evaluation dataset. The real dataset, being a strongly labeled dataset with a folder of short audio files, and a csv file containing the a short time frame (onset and offset) in a file and the label of that time frame, being what it is the sound of.
