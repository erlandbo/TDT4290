# Preprocessing of audio data

Exploriatory data analysis can be found in [eda-q-free.ipynb](eda-q-free.ipynb) where the audio of a motor cycle, car, normal bus and metrobus are inspected. Based on the analysis it is safe to assume that it should be possible to classify the vehicles into different categories based on their audio signature. 

A description of the different features can be found in [feature_exploration.md](feature_exploration.md).
