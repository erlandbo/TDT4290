Acoustic-based vehicle dimension measurement

Electronic toll collection (ETC) has played a key role in revolutionizing the flow of modern traffic, enabled more efficient and cheaper toll collection for road
owners, and provided policymakers with an effective tool to regulate traffic, most notably for dealing with urban congestion and pollution using different
pricing model. In most ETC systems, vehicles are equipped with a radio transponder, which can transmit the information about the vehicle to a receiver for
toll collection. However, without a transponder (e.g. foreign vehicles), automatic toll collection required a more complex solution that involved camera-based
plate reading and advanced censoring technology for vehicle identification and dimension measurement. This project aims to study the feasibility of replacing
the current expensive lidar-based system for vehicle dimension measurement with an acoustic-based solution with microphones. The project would involve
setting up the necessary equipment to collect and then analyze the sound of passing vehicles. The collected sound data will then be combined with
measurement data from our existing lidar-based system to develop and train machine learning models that are capable of deriving vehicle's properties such
as dimension or speed from just the acoustic (sound) signals.
